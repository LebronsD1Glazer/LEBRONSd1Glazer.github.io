<h1> PIECE BY PIECE</h1>
<p> Piece by Piece is a LEGO bricks story that tells the life story of singer/songwriter and record producer Pharrell Williams -- from his childhood in Virginia to his success in the music and fashion industry.
    PIECE BY PIECE is an unparalleled motion picture experience that captures the magic and brilliance of Pharrell Williams' creative genius, one LEGO® brick at a time. Uninterested in making a traditional film about his life, Pharrell set out to tell his story in a way that would set audience's imaginations free. Developed from his singular vision, PIECE BY PIECE defies genres and expectations to transport audiences into a LEGO world where anything is possible.—Focus Features</p>
